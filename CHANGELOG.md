## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0-rc.7] — 2026-05-16

### Added
- **Community-health docs.** `SECURITY.md` with concrete disclosure SLAs, `CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md`, `CHANGELOG.md`, `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/` (bug + feature), `.github/pull_request_template.md`, and `.github/dependabot.yml` for weekly security updates.
- **Real starter content for all 9 twin profile files.** `/api/invites/<token>/complete` now synthesises CONTEXT, DECISIONS, PEOPLE, PROJECTS, PREFERENCES, TONE from the wizard's collected data (previously placeholders).
- **Weekly activity tracking.** `employees-disk.ts` exposes `bumpActivityOnDisk`; `/api/twin/chat` bumps it on every request. The UI now shows real `questionsThisWeek` counts that auto-reset on ISO week boundaries.
- **In-UI API key management.** `/settings` lets the CEO add/clear Anthropic, Composio, and ElevenLabs keys without dropping to a terminal.
- **`update` CLI command actually updates.** Detects npm/pnpm/yarn installation method, prompts before running, falls back to printing the command on unknown setups.
- **Audit log rotation.** `audit.jsonl` is split into monthly `audit.YYYY-MM.jsonl` archives once it crosses 10MB or contains entries older than 30 days.
- **README screenshots.** Four PNGs (welcome, employees, flow, settings) replace the placeholder comment. `scripts/screenshot.mjs` regenerates them via Playwright.

### Changed
- `.gitignore` now ignores `.claude/` (Claude Code session metadata stays local).

## [0.1.0-rc.6] — 2026-05-16

### Changed
- CI release workflow auto-detects pre-release versions and publishes under the correct npm dist-tag (`next` for rc, `latest` for stable)

### Chores
- `docs/local/` gitignored to keep session notes and build logs out of the repo

---

## [0.1.0-rc.5] — 2026-05-15

### Added
- Invite creation is now blocked with a clear error when Anthropic or Composio API keys are missing — prevents silent failures during employee onboarding
- Brand fonts loaded at the root layout for consistent typography across all pages

### Fixed
- Real profile data now stored and served from disk; employee roster is fully disk-backed
- Employee card "done" state wired up correctly

---

## [0.1.0-rc.4] — 2026-05-14

### Added
- Copy-paste invitation links for CEO-driven employee onboarding — no terminal required for the employee side

---

## [0.1.0-rc.3] — 2026-05-13

### Added
- First-run CEO onboarding flow with founder introduction and onboarding video

### Changed
- Removed `EMPLOYEE001_DEMO` flag, baked-in personas, and all hard-coded demo data — fresh installs start from a clean slate

---

## [0.1.0-rc.2] — 2026-05-12

### Fixed
- Removed demo-id fallbacks that caused fresh installs (without `EMPLOYEE001_DEMO=true`) to behave unexpectedly

---

## [0.1.0-rc.1] — 2026-05-11

### Added
- Tag-driven GitHub Actions release workflow — push a `vX.Y.Z` tag to publish to npm automatically
- CI pipeline: lint + build on every push and pull request

### Infrastructure
- `CONTRIBUTING.md` — contribution guidelines, ground rules, and security contact

---

## [0.1.0] — 2026-05-10

### Added
- Initial public release
- Agent twins for every employee — always-on AI twins built from markdown profiles
- Twin council meetings — multi-twin debate and convergence on a single question
- Real tool execution via Composio MCP — Slack, Linear, email, code, and more
- Org Brain — shared knowledge graph every twin reads from
- On-prem by design — binds to `127.0.0.1`, all data stays in `./data/`
- Shared-secret token to gate LAN-exposed installs
- CLI commands: `setup`, `start`, `update`, `doctor`, `help`
- Human-controlled autonomy — approval gate before any sensitive tool call executes
